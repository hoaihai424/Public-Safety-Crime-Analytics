You are a software and AI/ML engineer with more than 10 years of experience in building project structures and especially in backend. Create a file structure for my project to ensure that each individual can use it flexibly but still independently. Here is the information about the project: Crime & Public Security Analysis 1. Field: Public Safety & Crime Analytics; 2. Analysis direction: Crime statistics by area, type, time; Dashboard predicts crime hotspots; Identify the relationship between crime and social factors (poverty, population, unemployment) 3. ML application: Classification predicts the type of crime likely to occur in an area; Clustering detects areas with similar crime patterns; Time Series Forecasting predicts the number of crimes by season. The process will be: first the backend processes data from the csv file and creates some new data for the dataset (using FastAPI), then saves it to data storage cassandra; from here the data continues to go into the ETL pipeline including Message queue (Kafka, Debezium), Data Processing (Pandas, Spark), Data Warehouse (Clickhouse); then the data goes in 2 directions: Visualize (Looker) and ML model (PyTourch, TensorFlow,...); From these two directions, the data will be displayed on a website (also the interface for the Decision Support System) using FastAPI and ReactJS. The goal is a clear project folder structure. The output format should be a flattened drawing like in the .md file, in the folder there should only be sample .md file. Note, only the structure should be built, not too influenced by the technologies. In addition, I use Docker to compose the project and in the future it may be Kubernetes.
